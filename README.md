# Batch converts scored EDF files of PSG data to csv and hypnogram image
- A simple Python script to convert .EDF files from [latest version](https://www.edfplus.info/downloads/software/Polyman.zip) of Polyman and saves hypnogram with same name as filename
![Hypno](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahulvenugopal/EDF_to_csv/main/results/demo_hypnogram_hypno.png)

# To Do
- Set the results path to results
- Add provisions to manage non sleep stage markers. At times we get body movement/snoring/arousal markers. This will throw a spanner in the script ☠️
- Current script won't work smoothly for old Polyman EDF files
